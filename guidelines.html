The 30-minute a day recommendation is for the average healthy adult to maintain health and reduce the risk of chronic disease.</div><div class=tips><h4>Tips for meeting the guidelines</h4><p>With busy work schedules, family obligations, and packed weekends, it can often be difficult to get the recommended amount of physical activity. Try these tips for incorporating exercise into your life:<ul><li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Do it in short bouts.</span> Research shows that moderate-intensity physical activity can be accumulated throughout the day in 10-minute bouts, which can be just as effective as exercising for 30 minutes straight. This can be useful when trying to fit physical activity into a busy schedule.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Mix it up.</span> Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity can be used to meet the guidelines. For example, you can walk briskly for 30 minutes twice per week and jog at a higher intensity on two other days.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Set your schedule.</span> Maybe it’s easier for you to walk during your lunch hour, or perhaps hitting the pavement right after dinner is best for you. The key is to set aside specific days and times for exercise, making it just as much a regular part of your schedule as everything else.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>The gym isn’t a necessity.</span> It doesn’t take an expensive gym membership to get the daily recommended amount of physical activity. A pair of athletic shoes and a little motivation are all you need to live a more active, healthier life.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Make it a family affair.</span> Take your spouse, your children, or a friend with you during exercise to add some fun to your routine. This is also a good way to encourage your kids to be physically active and get them committed early to a lifetime of health.</ul></div><div class=age><h3>Adults Age 65 and Older</h3><center><div class=chronic><p>(or adults 50-64 with chronic conditions, such as arthritis)</div></center><div class=adults-over><div class=one-activity><h4>Do moderately intense aerobic exercise 30 minutes a day, five days a week</h4><div class=moderate-intensity><p><span style=font-weight:bold>Moderate intensity</span>: <span style=font-style:italic>raising your heart rate and breaking a sweat, yet still being able to carry on a conversation.</span></div></div><div class=activity-or><h4>or</h4></div><div class=multiple><h4>Do vigorously intense aerobic exercise 20 minutes a day, 3 days a week</h4><div class=activity-and><h4>and</h4></div><h4>Do 8-10 strength-training exercises, 10-15 reps of each exercise 2-3 times per week</h4></div><div class=falling><p>If you are at risk of falling, you should perform balance exercises.</div></div><p>Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity is critical for healthy aging. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise means working hard at about a level-six intensity on a scale of 10. You should still be able to carry on a conversation during exercise.<p>Older adults or adults with chronic conditions should develop an activity plan with a health professional to manage risks and take therapeutic needs into account. This will maximize the benefits of physical activity and ensure your safety.</div><div class=tips><h4>Key points for older adults</h4><p>Although the guidelines for older adults and adults with chronic conditions are similar to those for younger adults, there are a few key differences and points to consider.<ul><li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Start, and get help if you need it.</span> The general recommendation is that older adults should meet or exceed 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most days of the week; however, it is also recognized that goals below this threshold may be necessary for older adults who have physical impairments or functional limitations.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Functional health</span> is an important benefit of physical activity for older adults. Physical activity contributes to the ease of doing everyday activities, such as gardening, walking or cleaning the house.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Strength training</span> is extremely important. Strength training is important for all adults, but especially so for older adults, as it prevents loss of muscle mass and bone, and is beneficial for functional health.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>If you can exceed the minimum recommendations, do it!</span> The minimum recommendations are just that: the minimum needed to maintain health and see fitness benefits. If you can exceed the minimum, you can improve your personal fitness, improve management of an existing disease or condition, and reduce your risk for health conditions and mortality.<li><span style=color:#6887f0;font-weight:bold>Flexibility is also important. </span>Each day you perform aerobic or strength-training activities, take an extra 10 minutes to stretch the major muscle and tendon groups, with 10-30 seconds for each stretch. Repeat each stretch three to four times. Flexibility training will promote the ease of performing everyday activities.</ul></div><center><div class=cta-button><a href=contact.html>BOOK A SESSION TODAY</a></div></center></div><div class=footer><div class=footer-logo></div><div class=footer-contact><h4>Fitness Therapy Trainer</h4><p><i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i>San Francisco, CA<p><i class="fa fa-phone"></i>Phone: (415) 205-2437<p><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> Email: pleung411@yahoo.com</div><div class=footer-nav><ul><li><a href=/home.html>Home</a><li><a href=/about.html>About</a><li><a href=/services.html>Services</a><li><a href=/testimonials.html>Testimonials</a><li><a href=/rates.html>Rates</a><li><a href=/contact.html>Contact</a></ul></div><div class=footer-subnav><ul><li><a href=/recommendations.html>Philip's Recommendations</a><li><a href=/guidelines.html>Exercise Guidelines</a><li><a href=/policy.html>Cancellation Policy</a></ul></div><div class=footer-copyright><i class="fa fa-copyright"></i><div class=year><script>document.write((new Date).getFullYear())</script></div><div class=copyright><p>Rachel Leung | All Rights Reserved</div></div></div><script>function myFunction(){var a=document.getElementById("myTopnav");"topnav"===a.className?a.className+=" responsive":a.className="topnav"}</script><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery||document.write('<script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=js/plugins.js></script><script src=js/main.js></script><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e[n]||(e[n]=function(){(e[n].q=e[n].q||[]).push(arguments)}),e[n].l=+new Date,c=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],c.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create","UA-XXXXX-X","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script>
